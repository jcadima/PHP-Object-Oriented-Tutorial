# How to use magic methods and constants

Magic methods start with a double underscore, these methods are triggered when certain conditions are met for example when we call or set undefined methods and properties. 

There are a couple of these magic methods, but only a few of them will be discussed, the more common one is one that is always used whether it has been declared or not.

The most common magic method is the PHP constructor method:
```php
__construct()
```
This method is called automatically when you create a new object:
```php
$student1 = new Student() ;
```
in the line of code above you could have declared a constructor method or not, if you did not then it automatically calls the __construct() method.

Remember that in the __construct() method you can initialize required class properties and even inject other classes.

Lets take a look at the most common magic methods:

| Method                          | Description                                                          |
|---------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| __get(string $property)         | used when reading data for inaccessible properties                   |
| __set(string $property, $value) | used when writing data to inaccessible properties                    |
| __isset(string $property)       | triggered when calling isset() or empty() on inaccessible properties |
| __unset(string $property)       | invoked when unset() is used on inaccessible properties              |

As stated in the table above the first two: **__get()** and **__set()** are used when working with properties that were not declared. To better understand these concepts lets look at an example:

**Note:** these example make use of PHP 7

```php
class Student {
    // no class properties here
    public function __construct() { }

    public function __get( string $fn) {
        $fname = "get{$fn}";
        if ( method_exists($this, $fname) ) {
            return $this->$fname() ;
        }
    }

    public function getId() {
        return "1337-2017";
    }

    public function getName() {
        return "Homer" ;
    }
}

// Lets try to access an inaccessible property: name
$s1 = new Student() ;
echo $s1->name;
echo PHP_EOL;
echo $s1->id;
/* OUTPUT:
Homer
1337-2017
*/

```
