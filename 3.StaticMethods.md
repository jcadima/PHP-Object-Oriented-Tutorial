# How to use static methods and properties

When we declare a method or property as static, we use the scope resolution operator ( :: ), an object is not created. Static methods and properties both have class scope, if a property is changed, all instances of that class will be able to access it.

Static methods and properties are mainly used for the following reasons:
* They are available anywhere in the script
* We can access its functionality without the need of creating an object
* Static properties are available to every instance of a class

There are certain cases where we might want to use static methods and/or properties, for example in configuration based classes such as Utility Classes, Config classes, API connections and Database connections.

Here is a redirect Utility class:

```php
class HttpUtil {
    static public function redirect( $url ) {
        header("Location: $url") ; 
        exit();
    }
}

// use HttpUtil
HttpUtil::redirect("http://juancadima.com/custom-php-mvc-framework-part-1-introduction/") ;

```


Lets examine the following class where we will run into some issues:

```php
class TestClass {
    static function staticMethod() {
        echo "calling a static method\n" ;
    }

    public function objectMethod() {
        echo "calling a dynamic method\n" ;
    }
}

$call = new TestClass() ;
$call->objectMethod() ;
$call->staticMethod() ;
TestClass::staticMethod();
// calling a non static method statically:
TestClass::objectMethod(); // Error

```

We can see that after we create a $call object and call
```php
 $call->objectMethod() ;
```
it prints the message as it should because it is an object context, next is the call to a static method
```php
$call->staticMethod() ;
```
this also works fine, but why?
This is because  a static method does not rely on the object context, its job is simply to taken and input and generate an output. This is bad practice and makes the code less understandable and this type of behavior may be deprecated in the future even if it doesn't generate any warnings with the latest PHP 7 versions.

```php
TestClass::staticMethod();
```
Works as expected, it is a static method

```php
TestClass::objectMethod();
```
This produces an error because objectMethod() expects an object context, as of PHP 7 this is deprecated:
```
PHP Deprecated:  Non-static method TestClass::objectMethod() should not be called statically
```
