# How to use magic methods and constants

Magic methods start with a double underscore, these methods are triggered when certain conditions are met for example when we call or set undefined methods and properties. 

There are a couple of these magic methods, but only a few of them will be discussed, the more common one is one that is always used whether it has been declared or not.

The most common magic method is the PHP constructor method:
```php
__construct()
```
This method is called automatically when you create a new object:
```php
$student1 = new Student() ;
```
in the line of code above you could have declared a constructor method or not, if you did not then it automatically calls the __construct() method.

Remember that in the __construct() method you can initialize required class properties and even inject other classes.

Lets take a look at the most common magic methods:

| Method                          | Description                                                          |
|---------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| __get(string $property)         | used when reading data for inaccessible properties                   |
| __set(string $property, $value) | used when writing data to inaccessible properties                    |
| __isset(string $property)       | triggered when calling isset() or empty() on inaccessible properties |
| __unset(string $property)       | invoked when unset() is used on inaccessible properties              |

As stated in the table above the first two: **__get()** and **__set()** are used when working with properties that were not declared. To better understand these concepts lets look at an example:

**Note:** these example make use of PHP 7

```php
class Student {
    // no class properties here
    public function __construct() { }

    public function __get( string $fn) {
        $fname = "get{$fn}";
        if ( method_exists($this, $fname) ) {
            return $this->$fname() ;
        }
    }

    public function getId() {
        return "1337-2017";
    }

    public function getName() {
        return "Homer" ;
    }
}

// Lets try to access an inaccessible property: name
$s1 = new Student() ;
echo $s1->name;
echo PHP_EOL;
echo $s1->id;
/* OUTPUT:
Homer
1337-2017
*/

```


We can see that we dont have a **$name** or **$id** properties declared in our Student class but somehow we were able to print the two properties.

The moment we tried to access **echo $s1->name**, __get() was invoked, we passed the string name to it, prepended with "get" and stored in **$fname**.
Then we check if this method exists in our class, if it exists it proceeds and calls the method that we declared in our class, if it does not exists it will resolve to NULL and nothing will happen.

# Default values for magic methods
Whenever we create an object sometimes we forget that our constructor required one or more parameters to initialize some class properties, and if we dont pass any parameters or forget to pass even one of the required parameters we risk breaking our code. 

This is when default constructor values come to the rescue:

```php
class Student {
    private $id = "000-000" ;
    public function __construct( string $id = null) { 
        if ( $id ) $this->id = $id;
    }

    public function getId() {
        return "New student with id#: " . $this->id;
    }

}
$s1 = new Student() ; // prints default id value
$s2 = new Student("99999") ; // id value was provided
echo $s1->getId(); 
echo PHP_EOL;
echo $s2->getId() ;
/*
New student with id#: 000-000
New student with id#: 99999
*/

```

# Working with Magic Constants

PHP offers a couple of useful magic constants that can be used for a variety of cases such as autoloading classes, debugging class methods, checking for the existence of class/method names and dynamically load file paths.

```php
class Student {
    private $id = "000-000" ;
    public function __construct( string $id = null) {
        if ( $id ) {
            echo "LINE " . __LINE__ . ": Id number provided\n" ;
            $this->id = $id;
        }
    }

    public function getId() {
        return "New " . __class__ . " with id#: " . $this->id ;
    }

}
$s1 = new Student() ; // prints default id value
$s2 = new Student("99999") ; // id value was provided
echo $s1->getId();
echo PHP_EOL;
echo $s2->getId() ;
```
