# PHP - Object Oriented Tutorial
The purpose of this tutorial is to explore Object Oriented Programming using PHP, these concepts have been around since 1970s and apply to any other languages that supports OOP.

PHP is a server side scripting language at its core, and it is used mainly for web development although it can be used for other tasks, it does a better job on the server side.

Object Oriented Programming has been around in other languages such as Java, C++, Javascript and others but in PHP it was added to PHP 5. 


# PHP 7: The new PHP
The language made new additions and surpassed PHP 5 versions in speed, you can view an infographic at zend's website [here](http://www.zend.com/en/resources/php7_infographic/)

Some helpful features were already used for a while before PHP 7 came out, additions such as:
* [Namespaces](http://php.net/manual/en/language.namespaces.php)
* [Traits](http://php.net/manual/en/language.oop5.traits.php)
* [Generators](http://php.net/manual/en/language.generators.overview.php)
* [Closures](http://php.net/manual/en/class.closure.php)
* [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/doc/00-intro.md)

Some Frameworks such as [Laravel](https://laravel.com/) are already began embracing PHP 7, to build web applications with Laravel version 5.5 requires PHP 7 at a minimum.
