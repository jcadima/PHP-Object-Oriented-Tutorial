# How to use static methods and properties

When we declare a method or property as static, we use the scope resolution operator ( :: ), an object is not created. Static methods and properties both have class scope, if a property is changed, all instances of that class will be able to access it.

Static methods and properties are mainly used for the following reasons:
* They are available anywhere in the script
* We can access its functionality without the need of creating an object
* Static properties are available to every instance of a class

There are certain cases where we might want to use static methods and/or properties, for example in configuration based classes such as Utility Classes, Config classes, API connections and Database connections.

Here is a redirect Utility class:

```php
class HttpUtil {
    static public function redirect( $url ) {
        header("Location: $url") ; 
        exit();
    }
}

// use HttpUtil
HttpUtil::redirect("http://juancadima.com/custom-php-mvc-framework-part-1-introduction/") ;

```


Lets examine the following class where we will run into some issues:

```php
class TestClass {
    static function staticMethod() {
        echo "calling a static method\n" ;
    }

    public function objectMethod() {
        echo "calling a dynamic method\n" ;
    }
}

$call = new TestClass() ;
$call->objectMethod() ;
$call->staticMethod() ;
TestClass::staticMethod();
// calling a non static method statically:
TestClass::objectMethod(); // Error

```

We can see that after we create a $call object and call
```php
 $call->objectMethod() ;
```
it prints the message as it should because it is an object context, next is the call to a static method
```php
$call->staticMethod() ;
```
this also works fine, but why?
This is because  a static method does not rely on the object context, its job is simply to take an input and generate an output. This is bad practice and makes the code less understandable and this type of behavior may be deprecated in the future even if it doesn't generate any warnings with the latest PHP 7 versions.

```php
TestClass::staticMethod();
```
Works as expected, it is a static method

```php
TestClass::objectMethod();
```
This produces an error because objectMethod() expects an object context, as of PHP 7 this is deprecated:
```
PHP Deprecated:  Non-static method TestClass::objectMethod() should not be called statically
```

# Using static methods inside a class
When we need to refer to our class properties and methods we use the $this keyword provided they are not declared static, if a class property or method are declared static we use the self, parent, and static keywords to reference static properties within the class.

This is an example of a simple class that outputs information about a file path, there are also static properties and methods:

```php
class FileMaster {
    private $fileinfo; 
    static public $counter = 0 ;
    public function __construct($filepath){
        self::$counter++;
        $this->fileinfo = pathinfo($filepath) ;
    }

    public static function instructions() {
        echo "Enter a file path ex: /home/user/joe/profile.png\n" ;
    }
    
    public function extension(){
        return  $this->fileinfo['extension'] ;
    }
    
    public function filename(){
        return $this->fileinfo['filename'] ;
    }
    public function dirpath(){
        return $this->fileinfo['dirname'] . DIRECTORY_SEPARATOR ;
    }

}


$fm = new FileMaster('/Users/person9/Pictures/armadillo.png');

echo FileMaster::instructions() ;  // static method call
echo $fm->extension() . PHP_EOL ; // png
echo $fm->filename() . PHP_EOL  ; // armadillo
echo $fm->dirpath() . PHP_EOL  ;  // /Users/person9/Pictures/
echo FileMaster::$counter;  // static property call

```

Note in the constructor we increment the value of counter by 1 and we no longer user the $this keyword, instead we use self to refer to a static property

```php
self::$counter++;
```
and we call the $counter value :
```php
echo FileMaster::$counter; 
```


Now lets take a look at static methods that might create unexpected results. First example will be a static sum method:

```php
$add = Calc::sum(2,2) ;
```
this wouln't create problems since it is stateless and doesnt remember anything or changes anything, it just provides an output, does not matter if there are many users making use of the static sum method.

Now lets look at an example that might be problematic:
```php
Visits::count(1) ;
$count = Visits::getCount() ;
```
Unlike the static sum method where we don't have to worry about the state of properties, this time if we have many users not working in isolation and sharing the same global space, we will have a case where count will not the value a user might expect it to be since it will be changing in many places, in this type of situation an object instance would be the appropriate solution where each user would own a separate counter.
